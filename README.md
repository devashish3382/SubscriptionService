# SubscriptionService
Add User, Get User, Purchase Plan, Get Plans

Overview You have been assigned with creating the primary REST service for a "Subscription as a Service" startup . Your REST service will be used by companies that will define subscriptions plans to which the users of the platform can subscribe to. Instructions General Instructions The submission will be evaluated for:
Correctness Code Readability: Please write well formatted, readable code with appropriate variable naming Technical Instructions You MUST implement the API using Nodejs. You can use any framework on top of Node. You MUST use an RDBMS to store data (one of Postgres or MySQLî‚‚. Submission Share the assignment as a link to git repo The git repo needs to track the commits you made as you solved the challenge. This is so that we can see how your code evolved. API Service The primary aspect of this programming challenge is to implement the following two APIs:
/user /subscription
The details of each of these APIs are as follows: /user This is a simple CRUD API that adds a user to DB. PUT /user/ creates a user with specified username in the DB.
Sample Input: PUT /user/jay  Required Output: Just a HTTP status: 200 on success, other appropriate code for failures
GET /user/< username> Sample Input: GET /user/jay Sample Output:
{      "user\_name": "jay",      "created\_at": "2020-02-29 19:30:00"  } 
/subscription This is the primary API being tested in this challenge. This will need to provide mechanisms to: Register a new subscription for an existing user, with a specified plan and start date POST /subscription/ Inputs:
{      "user\_name": < username >,     "plan\_id": < plan_id >,      "start\_date": < date in YYYY-MM-DD format >  } 
Sample Input
{ "user_name": "jay", "plan_id": "PRO_1M", "start_date": "2020-03-03" } 
Expected Output:
{ "status": <["SUCCESS"|"FAILIURE"]>, "amount": <+/- amount credited/debited> } 
Sample Output:
{ "status": "SUCCESS", "amount": -200.0 } 
Additional Details
On success, return 200 HTTP status. For failures, pick an appropriate HTTP code. The timestamp indicates the start date for the new plan, and it will be valid for the number of days shown in the table below plan_id can be one of those listed in the table below: 
GET /subscription/< username >/< date > Sample Input: /subscription/jay/2020-02-29
Note that the date in the above is optional: /subscription/jay
Expected Output:
When input date is specified
plan_id that will be active for user at specified date. Number of days left in plan from the specified input date Sample output { "plan_id": "PRO_1M", "days_left": 3 }
When input date is NOT specified
List all subscription entries available in database for user with start and valid till dates.
Sample output
[      {          "plan_id": "TRIAL",          "start_date": "2020-02-22",          "valid_till": "2020-02-28"      },      {          "plan_id": "PRO_1M",          "start_date": "2020-02-29",          "valid_till": "2020-03-30"      }  ]
